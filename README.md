# 🗄️ Dotfiles

A collection of my configs, dotfiles, and scripts...

Dotfiles can be described as a collection of files that are used to configure a system and give it your own personality, gestures and mannerisms.
Having a collection of dotfiles allows you to easily switch between them and easily update them.
Recommend you giving them a try!

## 🌲 Tree

```bash
dotfiles

## :8ball: Final thoughts

I will be updating this repo regularly, as my use of dotfiles increases.
